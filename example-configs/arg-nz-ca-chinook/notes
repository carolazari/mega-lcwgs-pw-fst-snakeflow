in config/
we have a bams.tsv --> this contains the 
sample	path	group
s001	.test/data/bams/s001.bam	grpA

not sure what the group refers to... maybe ask Anne. she run this before

we also have a chroms.tsv
chrom	num_bases
CM031199.1	14000000

list of chromosomes and the lenght?

a config.yaml

and the last file is a pwcomps.tsv 

pop1	pop2
grpA	grpB
grpA	grpC
grpB	grpC


I am assuming this referst to the kid of pairwise comparisons we want to perform.

on data/
we have the .bam and .bai files that can be found under the mega-non-model results/ovelap_clipped
